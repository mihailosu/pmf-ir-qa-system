# Information Retrieval Project
We have created this project as a part of course Information Retrieval at the University of Novi Sad Faculty of Sciences.

The aim of the project was to create an application asks user to input a question related to insurance, and then processes users
question through two layers. Based on the processing, the user is then given the best answer available from a pool of question and answer
dataset.
