Can Life Insurance Refuse To Pay?,"Life insurance companies can refuse to pay the death benefit if it is two years since the policy was purchased, and they find that there were misrepresentations on the application.

If the health questions are answered honestly, the life insurance policy will pay, because they base their approval upon what is written on the application. They also do not pay if death by suicide occurs during the first two years of the policy, or if there are explicit exceptions on a particular policy. E.g. Some policies will exclude payment if death is caused by piloting a private plane, but that is almost always spelled out in an amendment or rider.

What Does Medigap Mean?,"Medigap is another name for Medicare Supplement plans. Original Medicare (Parts A & B) only cover about 80% of a senior's health care expenses, leaving the insured responsible for the other 20%. While 20% doesn't sound like a very big figure, it can add up to a nice big medical bill really fast. For example, if you had a procedure done that cost $10,000 and Medicare paid for 80% ($8,000), you would be responsible for the other $2,000 of the bill - how many people can just get out their checkbook and write a check for that amount? That number can be a lot higher too. The idea of a Medigap plan is to cover the gaps in coverage that Medicare doesn't pay for (e.g. that other 20%). You pay a monthly premium to get these gaps covered so you're not hit with large bills. The resulting major advantage is it allows a senior to create a much, much more predictable health care expense structure - and when you're on a fixed income, this is vital. A plan F is the most comprehensive Medicare supplement plan available in the marketplace today - plans C, G, and N are very competitive as well. 
"
When Can I Sign Up For Medicare D?,"If youre signing up with a Part D plan for the first time, you may do so in one of three different enrollment periods, depending on your circumstances:The initial enrollment period- If youre not yet in Medicare and have no other drug coverage thats creditable (considered as good as Medicares), you can join a drug plan at any time during your seven-month initial Medicare enrollment period. This lasts from three months before to three months after the month you turn 65 (or, if youre younger with disabilities, the month you receive your 25th Social Security disability payment). You can also use this IEP if you turned 65 while living abroad or in prison. It lasts from three months before to three months after the month of your return or release. The special enrollment period- Youre entitled to an SEP in certain circumstancesfor example, if you lose creditable drug coverage (such as from an employer or union), or you turned 65 before moving abroad or going to prison and now want Part D coverage on your return or release. You do not have to request an SEP in these circumstances, but can just go ahead and sign up with a plan. This kind of SEP lasts 63 days and you must be receiving Part D coverage before it expires to avoid a late penalty. The annual open enrollment period If you miss your deadline for joining Part D during an IEP or an SEP, then you cannot enroll in a drug plan until the next OEP. This enrollment period (which until the end of 2010 ran from November 15 to December 31) now runs from October 15 to December 7 each year. You also have to wait for an OEP if you deliberately drop creditable drug coverage that you already have (for example, from an employer or union). The OEP also serves as an annual opportunity for anybody already enrolled in Part D to switch from one plan to another.

When Is Private Health Insurance Worth It?,"Private health insurance is not an investment so its' difficult to say when it is ""worth"" it.

What Is The Cost For Long Term Care Insurance?,"The cost for a long-term care insurance policy from a reputable company is running about $5,000 - $7,000 per year ($450/mo - $630/mo) for a person 55-60 years old, assuming that the person is healthy and can qualify for ""standard"" rate class. A ""preferred"" rate class would reduce those numbers by about 15-20%. Discounts can reduce premium significantly, if applicable.Long-term care insurance policies used to cost a lot less. But, to be truthful, insurance companies really miscalculated how much it would cost to pay out the high claims of an average policyowner and how much premium it would take to stay in business and make a profit. Even today, with higher premiums for the same coverage design available 10 years ago, the margins on this type of insurance are very thin. Recent claims history studies have shown that 1) policyowners do not allow these policies to lapse - less than 1% do, 2) more policyowners than anticipated are going on claim, and 3) the cost of medical facilities and skilled home care is going up at a greater rate than most consumer price indices (CPI).The take-away from all of this is in spite of the high cost, even a small, affordable policy is better than not having any coverage at all. A person's chance of needing at least some long-term care before death is greater than most other risks that people have insurance for. (However, it would not be prudent to purchase any long-term care insurance policy if going forward one knows that they will not be able to afford the premiums during retirement. If one can't afford the insurance, it is imperative to have a family discussion about a plan for family caregiving that might be needed before one dies.)There are lots of ways to keep costs for long-term care insurance affordable. Design is everything. To reduce premium and still have value, consider a lower-cost inflation rider or none at all; increase the maximum daily benefit to a higher amount than needed now and shorten up the number of years the pool of money is projected to minimally last; buy extra-cost riders only if your situation absolutely calls for them. Finally, buy young. Some LTCi experts suggest buying as young as 40. Most recommend that one not wait past 60 because premiums really start to climb after that age. By age 50, you should be seriously considering it. (I bought mine at age 53 and bought it on my wife when she was 49, and while it has been difficult in lean years to pay the premiums, I am so glad that we have kept the coverage in force. Neither of us would qualify medically to purchase it now.) 
"
What Is Employee Disability Insurance?,"Many businesses and corporations offer employee group benefit plans. The benefits may include disability insurance, usually short term disability insurance with a short elimination period. There are some employee group plans that offer an option to purchase additional disability coverage, but you should secure an individual disability quote and compare it to the benefit plan offered at work. 
"
Who Can Get Renters Insurance?,"Almot anyone occupying leased premises can get a renters policy. Everyone on the lease should be named as an insured in the policy and the landlord may require to be listed as an additional insured or as an additional interest. The policy is never guaranteed to be issued and does have underwriting requirement which might preclude someone from obtaining a policy. For example, ownership of a dangerous animal might cause a company to deny coverage. 
"
Can You Buy Motorcycle Insurance For 1 Month?,"Would you buy that coverage if they charged you the equivalent of six months premium? Issuing a policy for a month is as expensive as issuing coverage for a year. The cost of insurance is calculated using an assumption that the policy will last the length of the term, be it six months or a year. That is why a ""short-rate"" table exists to calculate the premium earned when a policy is cancelled before the end of the policy term. A short rate is recognition of the administrative burden and the cost is passed along in the premium you are charged. You can buy a policy on a six month term or for a year and then just cancel it but don't expect the actual cost for a month of insurance to be equal to 1/6th of 1/12th of the premium. It is likely to be much higher. But it is possible to end up with coverage for one month. You just may not like the premium charge when you're done with the coverage. 
"
Why Do Health Insurance Rates Increase?,"Health insurance rates increase because the underlying cost of health care services increases every year and our population's average consumption of health care services has been increasing for many years. If the cost of gasoline steadily rises and at the same time you are driving more miles each year then you understand it costs you more to operate your car. Health care services are the gasoline and using more health care per person is the increased miles driven part of the analogy above. That addresses the basic economic factors that have been happening for decades. Now add to those the impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) and you have a whole new set of cost drivers being added to the equation. For example, ObamaCare does add taxes and fees to insurance plan costs and medical devices - these costs are passed on to the consumer. The law mandates that a wide range of preventive health care services must be covered at 100%, all policies must cover maternity (many individual policies didn't), no medical underwriting is allowed, polices must be guaranteed to be issued and pre-existing conditions must be covered immediately, and these are just some highpoints of the coverage changes now required. While all of these requirements may sound good, and they do benefit many people, there is no way around the fact that such changes will increase health care consumption even further. More demand for a finite resource equals higher costs. An aging American population is also a driver of increased health care consumption and, with the Baby Boom generation entering their retirement years, will be for years to come. This gives you a generaloutline of why your health insurance rates have been increasing and will continue to be increasing for the foreseeable future. As I described above, our nation has many structural issues that drive health insurance rates higher. Despite its name, the Affordable Care Act serves mainly to expand access to health insurance and health care but does very little to address any of the underlying factors that lead to higher health insurance rates. 
"
How Much Does Renters Insurance Usually Cost A Month?,"I would say within my geographic area that the average renters insurance policy that I have dealt with is about 10-20 per month. The rate that you pay for this coverage can vary greatly depending on many factors. Some of those factors are geographic area, amount of coverage desired, deductible, age of building, number of units in the building, and more. Please contact a local agent to find out how rates stack up in your area.

Does AAA Provide Renters Insurance?,"AAA does indeed offer house, apartment and condo insurance. They also include a 10% discount on premiums if you are a AA member. Typically, renters insurance policies are the cheapest form of property coverage since the actual dwelling where you live, is not covered by you. However, you would have liability coverage included in your policy along with other benefits,including reimbursement if you had to temporarily move elsewhere because of a specific covered claim. 
"
Does My Husband Have Life Insurance?,"The first place to look is your husbands employer group plan to see if he elected life insurance. It may also be itemized on his pay stub or payroll check receipt. It is possible that his employer purchased life insurance on him as a key executive or part of his executive package separate from the businesses group plan. The next place to look is your checking account for payments that appear to be to an insurance company. 
"
Under What Circumstances Will Life Insurance Not Pay?,"I agree with Jeff, Mark and Jerry's answers, but I would like to add a bit more. Life insurance also will not pay a benefit if the death occurred in a commission of a crime and in some cases any act of war, such as militaryservice This is why the military provides its own coverage for our servicemen and women. I have seen some policies that also won't pay if the death was the result of an insurrection or riot. Basically, if you tell the truth on the application, you are not a current member of the armed forces serving in a war zone, and you are not a criminal, you should be okay! 
"
Does Life Insurance Count Net Worth?,"If your question is about applying for life insurance, the answer is yes. An underwriter will want to know your net worth along with your annual income and time in your current occupation. This information is needed in addition to height, weight, age, place of residence, health, medical history and lifestyle. All of these factors are used to calculate your mortality. If your question is about counting life insurance as an asset in your net worth, the answer is maybe. If you have term life insurance, then no, the face amount is not counted as an asset. However if you have a cash value plan, yes the current cash value of your whole life or universal life insurance is part of a person's net worth..

Can You Roll A 401K Into A Variable Annuity?,"Yes, you can roll a 401(k) into a Variable Annuity as long as the Variable Annuity is a qualified account, an IRA.

Be sure you understand the pro's and con's in relation to what your goals are. Seek an adviser or contact me if you want to look at some recommendations based on what your future goals are.

How Much To Budget For Homeowners Insurance?,"If you are contemplating the purchase of a home, the realtor can give you an estimate of the cost of a homeowners policy. Of course, a trusted insurance agent can provide a tailored made quote quickly. The agent should be able to guide you as you select appropriate limits, and set deductibles. Price is not the most important thing. Having the correct coverage at the time of loss is the most important thing, which is the value of the trusted insurance agent. 
"
Can I Put Insurance On An Automobile I Don't Own?,"In general, no, not for physical damage to the car. To insure property you need to have an insurable interest in the property you're protecting. In other words, you have to have something at risk. If you don't own it, what do you have at risk? This why titling is so important. You could, theoretically, put insurance on a car you don't own and not tell the insurance company that it's not titled to you. Hopefully, your insurance agent is experienced and professional enough to ask who the car is titled to, but it doesn't always happen. So, say you've insured this car you don't own and you get into an accident. You submit your claim to your insurance company to get your car repaired. One of the first questions a claims adjuster will ask is ""who is the car titled to?"". If the answer isn't you, you've got a problem. The insurance company will only pay the registered owner of the car. They are the only party that has a loss. The only exception to this is if the car is financed or leased. In this case, the finance company will require, as part of the contract, to be listed as a loss payee. This entitles them to collect on the damage to that car. That's how it applies to physical damage. For liability or injury, it's different. Here, the insurance follows the insured. You could, theoretically, get liability insurance without owning the car you're driving. Again, your agent will ask who owns the car, and they'll believe what you tell them. If a claim happens for injury or liability, they will protect you, the insured. I don't know why you'd want to insure a car you don't own, but I have an idea. It could be that a friend or relative is loaning you a car because you don't have one of your own or it could be that a child, or someone else in your household owns this car but doesn't want to, or can't, insure it themselves because they're young and it's expensive, or they have such a bad driving record they just plain can't get insurance. Either way, don't get yourself in a situation where you have to lie to your insurance company or agent. If something happens, the truth will come out and you may not get anything out of it anyway. Be smart. Find an agent you can trust and be truthful with him/her. They'll tell you the right way to do it so that you don't put yourself or your family at risk. 
"
How Much Is Renters Insurance For College Students?,"--> Normal 0 Before college students consider purchasing renters insurance, which I would refer to as tenant-homeowners insurance, I suggest they make the effort to find out if they are already afforded coverage by their familys homeowners or tenant-homeowners insurance. Students who maintain their primary residence as their familys home should be considered insureds under their parents policy. As an insured, their personal property should be covered anywhere in the world and in particular, at a temporary residence. In many cases, the coverage afforded by the familys policy will better than coverage they could buy on their own. Thats the first place I would check and I would get the response confirmed in writing. There may be limitations and deductibles to consider but in most cases the basic coverage should be adequate to cover most situations. Personal liability coverage should be available as well. For students who are no longer residents of their parents household (emancipated) or for parents who fear the impact of claims on their coverage, a separate policy could be considered. Insurers may be more reluctant to cover students on their own while at school but coverage should be available. A good place to start may be the parents insurer or agent. Basic policies with a $10,000-15,000 personal property limit should cost $200-300 a year. Coverage will be limited to specifically named perils, deductibles will apply and property will be covered for its actual cash value (not the cost to replace an old item with a new one). If replacement cost coverage is available, I suggest you consider adding it.

What Should I Know About Annuities?,"Non-qualified deferred annuities accumulate tax deferred.

What Do Employers Pay For Health Insurance?,"That is a great question! The rates paid by an employer will depend on a couple of things. The size of the workforce to be covered, the type of benefit plans to be offered, and the healthiness of the workers for example.

Regardless, they will pay a lot, Group plans can be expensive. If you have more questions, contact me, I'm happy to help. Thanks for asking!

How Much Is Individual Health Insurance In New Jersey?,"It varies from person to person. Your age, where you live, if you use tobacco products, and if you qualify for a subsidy to reduce your premium will determine how much a good policy is going to cost. Under the Affordable Care Act, you have the options for bronze, silver, gold, and platinum level plans (as you go up in metal, the price goes up, but provides better benefits) - some areas also have a catastrophic plan available. In addition, your age is a big factor as well. The younger you are, the cheaper your premium - the older you are, the higher your premium. Also, if you use tobacco products, your premium can be increased up to 50% as well. All of the plans offer good coverage.

What To Look For In A Good Health Insurance Plan?,"The definition of ""good"" varies from person to person and business to business. However, here are some of the aspects of a health insurance policy I advise my clients to be aware of and comfortable with: 1) Are the doctors, hospitals and pharmacies you want to use in-network providers with the health insurance plan you are considering? 2) What would your coverage be (if any) if you want to use a health care provider who is not an in-network provider with the health insurance plan you are considering? 3) What is the pharmacy benefit under the health plan you are considering? And, if you have specific prescription drug needs are they covered under the health insurance plan's prescription formulary and to what extent are they covered (copays, co-insurance, deductible & co-insurance)? 4) Does the health insurance plan allow its members to go directly to specialists such as cardiologists or does it require that you are referred to a specialist by your primary care physician first? 5) If you travel regularly outside of your home area (to other states or outside the USA) does the health plan provide for coverage outside of your home service area in the event you need non-emergency care? 6) Is the health insurance company you are considering a well established national or regional health insurance carrier with strong finances or is it one of the new, experimental Co-Op health plans recently established under the provisions of ObamaCare? 7) Does the overall value proposition of the health insurance plan you are considering meet your current and anticipated needs? In other words, does its monthly premium, coverage levels and provider network really work for you.
