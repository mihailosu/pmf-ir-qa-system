    "q": "What Happens When You Stop Paying Life Insurance?",
    "a": "\"That depends on the policy type. In most cases though the policy will be cancelled. Some policy's like universal life and some whole life policies may allow you to miss a payment without cancellations. If you just missed your payment date by a few days and it is the first time that you have missed a payment. I would contact your agent to see if the policy could be re-instated. Please remember every policy is different. Read your policy completely to know what coverage you have and what exclusions there may be or contact your local agent to have them go over the policy with you."
