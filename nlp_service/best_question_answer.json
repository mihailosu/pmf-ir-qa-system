    "q": "What Happens When A Term Life Insurance Term Ends?",
    "a": "\"Most term insurance policies increase dramatically in price after the level term period and clients simply stop paying for them and they lapse. Many term policies have conversion options that allow a policy owner to exchange part or all of their term policy into a permanent policy that will last forever. These options vary from company to company so its always good to ask an agent or call the insurance company."
